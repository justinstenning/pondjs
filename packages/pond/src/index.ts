/**
 * An `Index` is a specific instance of a `Window`. For example
 * a `Window` may represent "every day", and so an `Index` would
 * represent a specific day like last Tuesday in that case.
 *
 * There are two basic types, determined by string format supplied
 * in the constructor:
 *
 * * *Duration index* - the number of some unit of time
 *                       (e.g. 5 minutes) since the UNIX epoch.
 * * *Calendar index* - a calendar range (e.g. Oct 2014) that
 *                      maybe and uneven amount of time.
 *
 * For the first type, a multiplier index, an example might be:
 *
 * ```text
 *     1d-12355      // 30th Oct 2003 (GMT), the 12355th day since the
 *                   // UNIX epoch
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use seconds (e.g. 30s), minutes (e.g. 5m), hours (e.g. 1h)
 * or days (e.g. 7d).
 *
 * For the second type, a calendar style `Index`, here are several examples:
 *
 * ```text
 *     2003-10-30    // 30th Oct 2003
 *     2014-09       // Sept 2014
 *     2015          // All of the year 2015
 * ```
 *
 * A specific `TimeRange`, and associated data can be associated up based
 * on that string. It also allows us to represent things like months,
 * which have variable length.
 *
 * Indexes also contain a timezone, which defaults to UTC. For instance if
 * you have a day 2017-08-11, then the `TimeRange` representation depends
 * on the timezone of that day.
