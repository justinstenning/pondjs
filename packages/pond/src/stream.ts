/**

 *
 * A `StreamInterface` is the base class for the family of facards placed in front of
 * the underlying `Stream` to provide the appropiate API layer depending on what type
 * of data is being passed through the pipeline at any given stage.
 *
 * At this base class level, it holds onto a reference to the underlying `Stream`
 * object (which contains the root of the `Node` tree into which `Event`s are
 * inserted). It also contains the ability to `addEvent()` method to achieve this (from
 * the user's point of view) and `addNode()` which gives allows additions to the
 * tree.
 *
 * Note that while the tree is held onto by its root node within the `Stream` object,
 * the current addition point, the `tail` is held by each `StreamInterface`. When a
 * `Node` is appended to the `tail` an entirely new interface is returned (its type
 * dependent on the output type of the `Node` appended), and that interface will contain
 * the new tail point on the tree, while the old one is unchanged. This allows for
 * branching of the tree.

/**
 * `Stream` and its associated objects are designed for processing of incoming
 * `Event` streams at real time. This is useful for live dashboard situations or
 * possibly real time monitoring and alerting from event streams.
 *
 * Supports remapping, filtering, windowing and aggregation. It is designed for
 * relatively light weight handling of incoming events. Any distribution of
 * incoming events to different streams should be handled by the user. Typically
 * you would separate streams based on some incoming criteria.
 *
 * A `Stream` object manages a tree of processing `Node`s, each type of which
 * maps either `Event`s to other `Event`s or to and from a `KeyedCollection`.
 * When an `Event` is added to the stream it will enter the top processing
 * node where it will be processed to produce 0, 1 or many output `Event`s.
 * Then then are passed down the tree until an output is reached.
 *
 * When a `Stream` is initially created with the `stream()` factory function
 * the interface exposed is an `EventStream`. If you perform a windowing operation
 * you will be exposed to a `KeyedCollectionStream`. If you aggregate a
 * `KeyedCollectionStream` you will be back to an `EventStream` and so on.
 *
 * You can think of the `Stream` as the thing that holds the root of the processing
 * node chain, while either an `EventStream` or `KeyedCollectionStream` holds the
 * current leaf of the tree (the `tail`) onto which additional operating nodes
 * can be added using the `EventStream` or `KeyedCollectionStream` API.
 *
 * ---
 * Note:
 *
 * Generic grouping ("group by") should be handled outside of Pond now by creating
 * multiple streams and mapping incoming `Event`s to those streams. This allows for flexibility
 * as to where those streams live and how work should be divided.
 *
 * For "at scale" stream processing, use Apache Beam or Spark. This library is intended to
 * simplify passing of events to a browser and enabling convenient processing for visualization
 * purposes, or for light weight handling of events in Node.js such as simple event alerting.
 *
 * ---
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const result = {};
 * const slidingWindow = window(duration("3m"), period(duration("1m")));
 * const fixedHourlyWindow = window(duration("1h"));
 *
 * const source = stream()
 *     .groupByWindow({
 *         window: slidingWindow,
 *         trigger: Trigger.onDiscardedWindow
 *     })
 *     .aggregate({
 *         in_avg: ["in", avg()],
 *         out_avg: ["out", avg()],
 *         count: ["in", count()]
 *     })
 *     .map(e =>
 *         new Event<Time>(time(e.timerange().end()), e.getData())
 *     )
 *     .groupByWindow({
 *         window: fixedHourlyWindow,
 *         trigger: Trigger.perEvent
 *     })

 *         result[key] = col as Collection<Time>;
 *         calls += 1;
 *     });
 *
 * source.addEvent(e1)
 * source.addEvent(e2)
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * If you need to branch a stream, pass the parent stream into the `stream()` factory
 * function as its only arg:
 *
 * ```
 * const source = stream().map(
 *     e => event(e.getKey(), Immutable.Map({ a: e.get("a") * 2 }))
 * );
 *
 * stream(source)
 *     .map(e => event(e.getKey(), Immutable.Map({ a: e.get("a") * 3 })))
 *     .output(e => {
 *         //
 *     });
 *
 * stream(source)
 *     .map(e => event(e.getKey(), Immutable.Map({ a: e.get("a") * 4 })))
 *     .output(e => {
 *         //
 *     });
 *
 * source.addEvent(...);
 *
 * ```
 *
 * If you have multiple sources you can feed them into the same stream and combine them
 * with the `coalese()` processor. In this example two event sources are fed into the
 * `Stream`. One contains `Event`s with just a field "in", and the other just a field
 * "out". The resulting output is `Event`s with the latest (in arrival time) value for
 * "in" and "out" together:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const source = stream()
 *     .coalesce({ fields: ["in", "out"] })
 *     .output(e => results.push(e));
 *
 * // Stream events
 * for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
 *     source.addEvent(streamIn[i]);  // from stream 1
 *     source.addEvent(streamOut[i]); // from stream 2
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can do generalized reduce operations where you supply a function that
 * is provided with the last n points (defaults to 1) and the previous result
 * which is an `Event`. You will return the next result, and `Event`.
 *
 * You could use this to produce a running total:
 *
 * ```
 * const source = stream()
 *     .reduce({
 *         count: 1,
 *         accumulator: event(time(), Immutable.Map({ total: 0 })),
 *         iteratee(accum, eventList) {
 *             const current = eventList.get(0);
 *             const total = accum.get("total") + current.get("count");
 *             return event(time(current.timestamp()), Immutable.Map({ total }));
 *         }
 *     })
 *     .output(e => console.log("Running total:", e.toString()) );
 *
 * // Add Events into the source...
 * events.forEach(e => source.addEvent(e));
 * ```
 *
 * Or produce a rolling average:
 * ```
 * const source = stream()
 *     .reduce({
 *         count: 5,
 *         iteratee(accum, eventList) {
 *             const values = eventList.map(e => e.get("value")).toJS();
 *             return event(
 *                 time(eventList.last().timestamp()),
 *                 Immutable.Map({ avg: avg()(values) })
 *             );
 *          }
 *     })
 *     .output(e => console.log("Rolling average:", e.toString()) );
 *
 * // Add Events into the source...
 * events.forEach(e => source.addEvent(e));
 * ```
