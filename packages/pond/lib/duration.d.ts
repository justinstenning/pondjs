     *  * Passing a string to the constuctor will be considered a duration string, with a
     *    format of `%d[s|m|h|d]`
     *  * Passing a number and a string will be considered a quantity and a unit.
     *    The string should be one of: "milliseconds", "seconds", "minutes", "hours",
     *    "days" or "weeks"
     *  * Finally, you can pass either a `moment.Duration` or a `Moment.Duration-like`
     *    object to the constructor
     *
     * Example 1
     * ```
     * const thirtyMinutes = duration("30m";
     * ```
     *
     * Example 2:
     * ```
     * const dayDuration = duration(24, "hours");
     * ```
     *
     * Example 3:
     * ```
     * const p = duration({
     *     seconds: 2,
     *     minutes: 2,
     *     hours: 2,
     *     days: 2,
     *     weeks: 2,
     *     months: 2,
     *     years: 2
     * });
     * ```
     * In all cases you can use `new Duration()` or the factory function `duration()`.
